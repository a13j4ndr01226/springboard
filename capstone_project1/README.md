Note: artists_scraper and artists_enricher are the 2 main codes for extraction.

## Before Running it

    1. Create a `.env` file and save it under a folder config/ in the project root to store your API keys:
        SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
        SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
    
    2. Install dependencies:
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    3. Ensure internet access and a valid IP address when running the Google Trends portion, as repeated requests 
    may trigger temporary blocks.

## How to use it

    1. Run the Spotify scraper to extract rising artists by genre and region
        python artists._scraper.py
    
    2. Run the Google Trends enricher to get daily interst scores for those artists
        python artists_enricher.py

    3. Output files will be saved in the data/ directory
